<h1>Extreme value theory for modelling snowfalls in the Alps</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

This repository contains the project I undertook during my internship at the University of Edinburgh (Summer 2024), under the supervision of Dr Jordan Richards.


<h2>Abstract</h2>

Extreme value analysis (EVA) has emerged as one of the most important statistical disciplines for the applied sciences over the last 50 years. The distinguishing feature of EVA is the objective to quantify the stochastic behaviour of a process at unusually large, or small, levels. In particular, EVA usually require estimation of the probability of events that are more extreme than any that have already been observed.

In this project, we produce R code to model extreme snowfalls in the Italian Alps using a specific EVA model called threshold model. We predict an upper bound for the snowfall received in each region, and we investigate which covariates are statistically significant for snowfalls.
